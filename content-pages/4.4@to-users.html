	<p>Even though my projects still end up in my portfolio. Fair enough.</p>

<p data-scroll data-scroll-offset="30%, 0" class="text centi focus">I am <strong>not designing for a Director</strong>. I am not designing for an *very important* stakeholder. I am <strong>not desiging for showing off</strong> in my portfolio.</p>


<div style="height:30vh;"></div>


<p data-scroll data-scroll-offset="30%, 0" class="text centi focus">Actually the only thing <strong>I want to show</strong> off in my portfolio are <strong>features and products that are used</strong>.</p>


<div style="height:30vh;"></div>


<p data-scroll data-scroll-offset="30%, 0" class="text centi focus">And at the end of the day, <strong>the Director</strong> or the *very important* stakeholder all <strong>want</strong> the same thing : the <strong>product to be used</strong> and <strong>to bring value.</strong></p>

<p data-scroll data-scroll-offset="30%, 0" class="text kilo highlight rollout">Real users.</p>


<div style="height:30vh;"></div>


<p data-scroll data-scroll-offset="30%, 0" class="text centi focus">So I once again take the risk of getting cheesy, but <strong>my work starts with users</strong>, and <strong>ends up with users.</strong></p>



<div style="height:30vh;"></div>


<p data-scroll data-scroll-offset="30%, 0" class="text centi focus">Especially as a Product Designer, it is quite <strong>tempting to spend time</strong> <strong>crafting beautiful</strong> and innovative <strong>interfaces</strong> for a feature. But this is most likely <strong>going to satisfy your self-ego</strong> rather than the end users.</p>


<div style="height:30vh;"></div>


<p data-scroll data-scroll-offset="30%, 0" class="text centi focus">I try to constantly <strong>stay aware of the user context</strong> when <strong>taking any design decisions</strong> for a solution. It all starts by shadowing users, by getting to know them and what they need to achieve (and not building *Personas* by projecting a bunch of clichés of users we dream of).</p>


<div style="height:30vh;"></div>


<p data-scroll data-scroll-offset="30%, 0" class="text centi focus">It follows with <strong>proper user research work</strong>, then with <strong>iterative product vision</strong> crafting with <strong>user testing.</strong></p>


<div style="height:30vh;"></div>


<p data-scroll data-scroll-offset="30%, 0" class="text centi focus">And it ends with setting up and <strong>following analytics</strong> to *actually* know <strong>what and how users use</strong> the implemented feature.</p>





<div style="height:40vh;"></div>


<p data-scroll data-scroll-offset="30%, 0" class="text kilo highlight rollout">Users won’t tell you what to do.</p>


<div style="height:30vh;"></div>


<p data-scroll data-scroll-offset="30%, 0" class="text centi focus">But do not get it wrong, I do <strong>never expect users to tell</strong> the team <strong>what to do.</strong> Awareness of <strong>user needs and context</strong> is just another <strong>input to feed all the decision-making</strong> that needs to take place when designing a product or a feature. <strong>Users are not stakeholders</strong>, the team only (Product Managers, Engineers, Designers, Stakeholders...) have the last word on what should be done.</p>
