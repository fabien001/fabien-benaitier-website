	<p class="text mili">As a Product Designer, peers opinions are harsh. You consciously spend a whole day crafting the *perfect* user flow for that new feature. Just to have some other Designer notice the one corner case you missed in your flow that's going to ruin your users experience 40% of the time.  Or it's a Developer who will point out the sheer amount of technical hassle it will be to develop your awesome neumorphic picture carousel.

	Same carousel that, according to the Product Manager, is far from bringing the value matching the business goals for this feature.

	I don’t remember of any time I did not make at least 3 iterations for a given feature, with feedback sessions with engineers, product managers, or designers.</p>
